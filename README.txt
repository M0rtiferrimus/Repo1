This will be my README, since GitHub wants me to add one to the repo so badly.
I suppose this is as good a place as any to state my business in uploading
things to the internet.
I'm learning new skills that will help me with programming, hacking, scripting,
problem solving, and lots of other stuff. I am not going to be pretentious about
my skills: I am fairly experienced with computers, but I am still a novice
when it comes to programming and scripting.

I suppose the main motivation for me to learn more about scripting is that I 
don't want to be a "script kiddie." For those who don't know what a script
kiddie is, it's a person who is completely ignorant about the inner workings
of a script or program, who uses pre-made scripts and programs to hack.
Script kiddies usually credit themselves as "computer experts" or
"expert hackers" because of their "skills" in using others' programs and
scripts.
I don't want to be a parasite, in short. And neither do you, I'm sure.
At some level, it's okay to just take a pre-made program when it's not
worth re-inventing the wheel, or when the program/script's function is
extremely advanced, and just use it. On the other hand, everyone should
have at least a basic ability to make these things on their own. I, for
one, will do my best to educate myself about scripting, then programming.
In my view, scripting is much more useful than programming because so
many utilities are scripts, not programs. Programs are more useful for
tasks that require GUI's, many options, and a dynamic control system.
Scripts are more useful for basic, necessary functions. In a way, scripts
extend what your operating system can do, since everything on the OS is
in essence a script or a file to be used with a script.
So, that's why I'm learning scripting first. First, I'll learn batch
scripting, since Windows is so ubiquitous and my primary computer is a
PC. Then, I'll move on to bash scripting on my Linux virtual machine.
I may look into porting Linux scripts to Mac, but Apple puts so many
limits on their software that I'm not sure I could get it to work
on a virtual machine on my Windows host. But I digress.
So, priority is Windows->Linux->Mac. After that, I will move on
to mobile devices, such as Android phones and iPhones/iPod Touches
(yes, I will acknowledge the iPod Touches, as nobody else seems to)
and spread my scripting influence everywhere.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. First thing's first: gotta go learn
some bash. See you later!
